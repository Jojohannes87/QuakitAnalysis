29,"Description of the compulsory exercises as regards criteria(Visibility,Centrality,Connectivity,Accessibility)

I consider the crime prevention through the environmental design because the cape town, South Africa is one of the most dangerous places with high rate of crime occurrences such as burglars and heavy crimes.

Please see the bellow urls:
http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/110133/cape-town-is-now-among-the-10-most-violent-cities-in-the-world/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_South_Africa

All of the criteria can be integrated in terms of the crime prevention through environmental design and the sustainable urban neighbourhood.

Prof.Bill Hiller provided a report on a number of London districts for crime and urban design oriented to sustainability and security heuristically.

London is akin to New York and Los angeles in the crime rate with not good reputation.
http://www.spacesyntax.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Hillier-Sahbaz_An-evidence-based-approach_010408.pdf

As such, I aim to make crime preventive physical layout knowing that social factors have effects on the issue alike.

Exercise description:

For now, I work intuitively on the criteria in theory.

Block lay out:

Blocks for 68 two-storey housing are located along the main roads and in other vehicle accessible roads and pedestrian paths, and south facing for intake of the good sunlight in heating and the predominant wind from the south in natural ventilation.

They are attached in a row reducing free sides, which expects to reduce the exposure of each of dwelling units to burglars' search paths and the dead points at night in which, less public surveillance is likely to be made than that in the day.

Those housing blocks attached should be partitioned by Fire walls.
Furthermore, every unit block has the ground floor space occupied, which gives the sense of the security and human presence.

Visibility, Connectivity, Accessibility,Integrated livelihood programme:

The block layout has the permeability and faces both main vehicular roads or pedestrian roads which are connected in through-movement and accessible in East-West and North-South in relation to the existing crossings.

Every building block can be provided with its own rear-terraces with recognisable boundaries, defined as semi-public space(semi-private space) in relation to the building block as private space and to roads and courtyard as public space.

All open spaces such as large courtyards in the south west, roads and rear-terraces are recognisable for the users and passers-by, which contributes for the public surveillance.

The site area has the preference of modal split for the pedestrians and so vehicle accessible roads such as the central transverse ones and South peripheral ones restrict the speeds and may set movable poles in the entry points next to the main roads in order to limit vehicle access in the ordinary time.
Furthermore, as all pedestrian roads, the vehicle accessible roads are used for delivery and  secure egress routes at the emergency as well as fire engine accessible routes.

Centrality, Ecological Landscape management:

At the community scale, the site area is surrounded by a few schools and community facilities.
With it in mind, the roads are planned with the nearby connections with those built elements in the site.
A block at the eastern corner of the site facing the Njongo Avenue is expected to be used as the community space with the sanitary units.
A courtyard in the south west is used for a playground and any other recreational place for the neighbourhood.
All of the rear-terraces and a courtyard are properly landscaped without impeding the visual integration and the public surveillance.

The buildings here form the perimeter of the complex as well as a means to insulate the community and ensure that it is a protected environment from outer disturbances given the current social stigma toward poorer minorities the world over. In terms of infrastructure, the layout is also easy to serve due to the relatively linear connection of each building to the next while the entry points provide vistas for visibility to visitors and families keeping track of one another. The approximate orientation of each building also removes safety hazards such as hiding spots or inaccessible areas in the event of a fire and opens up all sides of each building as potential exit routes. The layout is also intentionally inhospitable to cars that would otherwise use the surrounding streets for parking or driving so as to minimize potential incidents from frequent pedestrian activity.",2016-09-19 21:00:32,"http://qua-kit.ethz.ch/mooc/proposals/view/27","anonymous edX student",1

The smaller dwellings form an inner-ring of shared space with the larger dwellings on the perimeter. My intention is to create an area of shared space whilst giving each dwelling as much of its own space as possible. Not an easy trade-off. 

I have been living in a post-Soviet district of Berlin for the last few years so the sense of order and symmetry is clearly influential. I wanted to prioritise the idea of macro-space for the whole community rather than subdividing the space too much. Clearly I have only partially succeeded in that. I am sure there are many more considerations which I hope to learn throughout the X-Series.

Instead of formal grids, rigid linearity, or other top-down geometries, I tried to allow the alignment to respond to the site's geometry. The design is done as explained below:
1. Connectivity: group of buildings are connected together in a loop that forms a courtyard. This inner courtyard can be personalized for the sharing neighbors for hanging laundry, visit gatherings, parties, etc. A green landscape within can offer views from the back elevations. In addition, extension from the back of each house is possible for a few meters.
2. Accessibility: the site is bordered by two main streets and two settlement areas. The design creates main axes that allow the inhabitants and crossers-by to easily access the site. Secondary paths cross between building blocks into a main inner courtyard of a group of buildings.
3. Centrality: Besides the smaller central courtyards, a central area in the middle of the site is created for communal purposes; gatherings, playgrounds, cultural events, etc.
4. Visibility: The visible axes that cut through the main site gives a welcoming sense that it is easily accessible and permitted of entry by any one, so not to make it closed and like a prison. The central courtyard is a visible spot in the middle that serves as a landmark and central space. In addition, each house has a few meters in the front of the building along the main street/pathways that serves as a visible personal space to personalize and individualize.",2016-10-02 20:49:38,"http://qua-kit.ethz.ch/mooc/proposals/view/640","Assila Al-Ahmad",4

It's not a posh locality and thus in an informal neighbourhood like this, the immediate neighbours become one's family. The units have been arranged in a pattern that 'Small clusters'(with no particular set/type of units). Each of these clusters have an open area (like a play area/sit out space/ courtyard) for themselves. But they are placed such that each of these are mutually accessible in terms of connectivity and visibility.

 The site has two main access roads through it. They are not perpendicular to the main roads in order to decrease visibility from outside(of the units and spaces between them for safety reasons). They decrease the distance to be travelled by each person to exit the site. There are smaller streets that connect and make each block accessible. I have assumed that the community is not gated, thus the clusters closest to these openings have been designed as introverted spaces(rather than completely open). 

All the clusters have been laid out around a central cluster which encloses a large playground(this can be landscaped and playground equipment can be installed)This can become a space used by the whole community and by people from all age groups. It has been given access on 4 sides.

Another criteria I kept in mind while planning was the North direction(approximately along that corner of the site that lies at the intersection of the main roads).

1) On of my lines of thinking would be using solar energy as well as possible, but we don't know where North is, so that is a problem to place them in the right orientation;
2) another line of thinking would be to create some space for community activity and community building. This will involve placing the highest and longest buildings on the street sides, providing a physical barrier for the noise coming from there. I would place the highest building near the crossing, for orientation;
3) There is little information on the surroundings, so it is difficult to choose vision lines. It would be logical though for the open space to be visible from the street at two places on both neighbouring streets, about halfway;
4) the buidlings could be grouped in three groups in the corners of the field. I thionk 68 buildings is a bit much for people to feel connected. Smaller grouos, like 22 to 24 seems more appropriate.

The themes are two-fold: public-facing street domiciles that hybridize live-work with integrated livelihood on the ground floor; and interior community living clusters. The building clusters are grouped to evoke African geometric and pictographic imagery, placed along one central and four secondary axes. The community functions as a campus whose residents steer its living, work and ecology. The goal is a neighborhood supporting its residents' culture with creative functionality and amenities, fostering sustainability and stewardship.

Lining the two streets along the community edges are block-length domiciles with safe visibility along street lines and into interior axes. They are a visual-sound buffer for buildings to the interior. The buildings along each street have centered symmetrical form that is similar to yet differentiated from each other. This approach is to give the village a public-facing aspect to share its industry and present a vibrant street presence and identity. By using a modest setback and creating a further opening into the community at their intersection, the buildings are placed such that their access points to the interior are endpoints for the primary axis. Therefore, the secondary axes perpendicular to it have ample space around the building clusters. This balances vital circulation and spatial integration that is functionally and aesthetically appealing for the residents' social lives. Here, homes are intended to offer neighbors creative isovists from indoors or outdoors, whether walking, or stationary but looking around.

This maximizes space efficiencies by creating more recreational space as a whole for kids to play, adults to socialize and share meals together than you would have if each unit had a small plot of land. Depending on size you could even potentially erect small playsets for kids. I don't know the overall vision for use of land in this project but feel outdoor recreation space can dramatically change the experience for residents even if technically the land could be needed for housing.

Allow the pass of vehicles as police, ambulances, firefighters… and the passage for section outsiders.
Avoid in the possible dangerous spaces for security, trying to look for clear and big spaces.

It can be achieved by creating the outer ""U-shape"" of apartment blocks slightly higher (vertical building) than the inner => reduced number of separate buildings and a gorgeous view + more space for garden, playground and relaxation area. In general, the U-shape of the apartment blocks is meant to protect from strong winds, create a place for residents to relax (courtyard) and simply reduce the traffic and everyday's noise from streets.",2016-10-03 11:01:17,"http://qua-kit.ethz.ch/mooc/proposals/view/660","andav59/ Anda Varna",1

620,"My principal idea was create spaces between the houses where the people can coexist sharing the front or sharing the backyard (green areas) With the purpose of create micro climates to refresh every house and it also allows greater security having open views from everywhere. I also pretend to create a center for everybody where the principals roads intersect (they are the continue of the existing street). Also they can access pedetrian from everywhere and generate 4 differents views depending of where you are or where they came.",2016-10-06 10:41:13,"http://qua-kit.ethz.ch/mooc/proposals/view/734","anonymous edX student",3
